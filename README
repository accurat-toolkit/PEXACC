To do a quick test-run, just issue (from this directory) the command:

./pexacc2.pl --source en --target ro --input test/wiki-en-ro-docalign-test.txt --output test.out

If on Windows, be sure to configure the file 'cluster.info' and 'pexacc2conf.pm' first!
In Windows it is recommended to run PEXACC under Cygwin.
